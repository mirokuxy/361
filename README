----- Make command -----
	make
------------------------


-- Execution command ---
	./FruitTetris3D
------------------------


------------- Game Instruction -------------

1) to manipulate camera

ctrl + 'up' : move up
ctrl + 'down' : move down
ctrl + 'left' : move left
ctrl + 'right' : move right
mouse roll forward : magnify objects / decrease FOV
mouse roll backward : minify objects / increase FOV

PS : The camera always looks at the center of the game window

2) to manipulate the robot arm

'w' : move up
's' : move down
'a' : move left
'd' : move right
'space' : drop fruit

3) to manipulate tiles

'up' (direction key) : rotate the tile
'down' (direction key) : accelerate falling
'space' : shuffle the fruits within the tile

4) general game control

'z' : suspend game / continue game
'r' : restart game
'q' : quit game 

---------------------------------------------


----------- Game Logic Explanation ----------

1) Any full row will be removed

2) Any consecutive 3 fruits of the same the kind will be removed

3) Remove happens after tiles lands

4) 1) & 2) can happen at the same time

5) After remove happens, fruits that are then not connected to the ground (directly or indirectly) will begin to fall

6) Falling fruits that are connected to each other will fall as a whole

7) Falling ends only when the connected fruits as a whole lands on some ground

8) When any of these new falling fruits is still falling, no user-controlled tile will generate, nor can user control these free falling fruits

9) After all the free falling fruits lands, a user-controlled tile will be generated immediately

new about robot arm:

10) tile cannot be shuffled or rotated when on a robot arm

11) tile cannot no longer be moved left or right after leaving the robot arm

12) tile cannot be dropped from robot arm when it's out side of the game window or colliding with other tiles

------------- Additional Features -------------

1) camera control :
	camera can move up and down

2) Texture :
	Each kind of fruit is represented by a corresponding picture with corresponding color.

3) Game Info and Control :
	'z' to suspend and continue game;
	prompt in terminal window when game ends;

4) Multiple Shaders :
	vshader.glsl , fshader.glsl : to draw tiles and robot arm
	vshaderGrid.glsl , fshaderGrid.glsl : to draw backgournd
