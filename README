----- Make command -----
	make
------------------------


-- Execution command ---
	./FruitTetris
------------------------


------------- Game Instruction -------------

1) to manipulate camera

'w' : move up
's' : move down
'a' : move left
'd' : move right
mouse roll forward : magnify objects / decrease FOV
mouse roll backward : minify objects / increase FOV

PS : The camera always looks at the center of the game window

2) to manipulate tiles

'up' (direction key) : rotate the tile
'left' (direction key) : move left
'right' (direction key) : move right
'down' (direction key) : accelerate falling
'space' : shuffle the fruits within the tile

3) general game control

'z' : suspend game / continue game
'r' : restart game
'q' : quit game 

---------------------------------------------


----------- Game Logic Explanation ----------

1) Any full row will be removed

2) Any consecutive 3 fruits of the same the kind will be removed

3) Remove happens after tiles lands

4) 1) & 2) can happen at the same time

5) After remove happens, fruits that are then not connected to the ground (directly or indirectly) will begin to fall

6) Falling fruits that are connected to each other will fall as a whole

7) Falling ends only when the connected fruits as a whole lands on some ground

8) When any of these new falling fruits is still falling, no user-controlled tile will generate, nor can user control these free falling fruits

9) After all the free falling fruits lands, a user-controlled tile will be generated immediately
